  Hi, my name's Ilya and I'm Unity 3d developer. Throughout last year, I made significant progress in enhancing my skills as a Unity developer. 
  My daily efforts focused on teamwork, effective communication, thorough research, and continuous learning of programming languages, with a particular emphasis on object-oriented programming.
  As a result of my project-based learning and self-teaching experiences, I possess knowledge of the Unity Engine and C#. 
  I am currently seeking a career as a Game Developer, and I believe my passion for continuous learning and self-improvement
  will be invaluable in achieving my goals. With a proactive mindset, I am committed to daily growth and development,
  and eager to leverage my talents and expertise to make meaningful contributions in the field.

  I am most skilled in:<mark>Unity</mark>, <mark>FMOD</mark> and <mark>Sound Design</mark>

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
