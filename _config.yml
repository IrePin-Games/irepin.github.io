about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am Ilya, and I specialize in developing applications using Unity 3D. Throughout last year, I made significant progress in enhancing my skills as a Unity developer. 
  My daily efforts focused on teamwork, effective communication, thorough research, and continuous learning of programming languages, with a particular emphasis on object-oriented programming.
  As a result of my project-based learning and self-teaching experiences, I possess knowledge of the Unity Engine and C#. 
  I am currently seeking a career as a Game Developer, and I believe my passion for continuous learning and self-improvement
  will be invaluable in achieving my goals. With a proactive mindset, I am committed to daily growth and development,
  and eager to leverage my talents and expertise to make meaningful contributions in the field.

  I am most skilled in:<mark>Unity</mark>, <mark>FMOD</mark> and <mark>Sound Design</mark>

          IrePin-Games is a project focused on developing a series of games set in the same fictional universe.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          IrePin-Games is a personal endeavor of mine where I am working on creating multiple games that exist within the same fictional universe. 
          The premise of these games revolves around the conflict between the C.A.T.S. special unit and the "Zorbo" organization. 
          The latter aims to seize control of the world and enforce its oppressive, slave-like ideology on the global population.

          Throughout this course, I was able to elevate my skills from a beginner level to an advanced level. I gained valuable knowledge on managing and organizing complex projects, created a custom Grid System, and learned advanced programming concepts including C# generics, C# events, and custom structs. In addition, I also learned about A* Pathfinding, which was an added bonus.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      I was working on TV like an editor near 10 years.
      From this experience I can say that I am very stress-resistant and know how to work in a team.
      But over time I realised that this job was not really my thing. 
      I've been thinking for a long time about how to get closer to game development. 
      I played a lot of games and realised that I enjoyed figuring out how their mechanics worked. 
      So I decided to change careers and started training in the field. 
      I have completely immersed myself in the world of video game development.
